Deployment will be coming within the next few days. In the meantime, you can clone the repository and run it yourself. Once you've cloned it, open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you cloned it. Activate the python virtual environment with 'w_venv\scripts\activate'. Then navigate to the 'backend2' folder and run 'python manage.py runserver'. Then, open a seperate command prompt and navaigate to the 'frontend' folder. Run 'npm start' and the website will open up for you on your default web browser.
